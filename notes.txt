yes so I'm changing it to go to a checkout form where we capture 

: name, 
: number, 
: email, 
: delivery address and 
: additional note before 
: going to hubtel (so remove the additional note on the pricing page)


TASK LIST

DONE: ic and fc in the db should be corrected to the proper decimal places.

: on selecting option for an item, the unit price and the total price should be calculated and displayed

: submission of the form, storing of data, and redirection to the checkout form

: storage of client checkout details and redirection to hubtel for payment. [ order should indicate it's payment status ]

: display various tabs for editing each of the db tables

: navigating to admin panel from home screen

: data entry from the pdf to the db
